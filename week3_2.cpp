    1) AC : Accepted
    2) WA : Wrong Answer
    3) TLE : Time limit exceeded
    4) MLE : Memory limit exceeded
    5) RE : Runtime error
        -NZEC: Non zero exit code
        -SIGSEGV: usually due to out of bounds
        -SIGFPE: Usually division or modulo by 0
        -SIGABRT: Due to assert statements*/
